AJAX is the art/technique of exchanging data with a server and updationg parts of a web page-without reloading the whole Page.
        Ajax is not a programming language. 
        Ajax is a technique used by web developers in order to make website behave like desktop applications. 
        Example of application that uses ajax are Gmail, Google, MAps, Youtube and Facebook tabs. 
        
        There are two types of requests/communication ways in client server architecture are: 
        1. Synchronous 
        2. Asynchronous 
        
        The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object. 
        All modern browser support the XMLHttpRequest object. 
        The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes. 
        This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page. 
        Transfer data in the form of plain text, XML or JSON format. Retrieve data from the server asynchronously. 
        
        
        //GET and POST GET method 
        
        The length of a URL is limited to 2048 characters. 
        GET method can't be used to send binary data. 
        Ex:- images or word documents. 
        
        //POST requests It is used with sensitive data. can be used with binary data.

        Without jQuery, AJAX coding can be a bit tricky. 

        //agar aap jquery use na karke javascript use karte h to aapko code bahut likhna padega. 
        This means that you have to write extra code to test for different browsers. 
        However, the jQuery team has taken care of thisfor us, so that we can write ajax functionality with only one single line of code. 
        

        jQuery AJAX methods 
        1. Load 
        2. Get 
        3. Post 
        4. ajax
